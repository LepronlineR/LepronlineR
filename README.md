# 🎨 Projects

## [Project Protocol 🔌](https://github.com/MattLMerritt/protocol-protocol)
Project protocol is a website where protocols are displayed and explained through documentation and simulations.

</div>
A .json file with configurations of a graph is provided or generated, and then sent to a simulator. The simulator runs and provides and output file of the graph as well as the timestamp of information of the protocol interactions, then outputs a .json to a graph visualizer. Then the results gets rendered into a .gif and displayed above. Certain graphs can be ordered or disordered, depending on the user configuration. 

## Force Directed Graph with Visualizing in the Campfire 🌎
The Campfire is a multidimensional visualization tool developed by the Rensselaer IDEA. In this project, a force directed graph is utilized in order to visualize data of neighbors. For instance, the amount of times two characters interacted with each other is recoreded as a weight of connection between the two characters. Then the graph applies a geometric constraint that forces the directed graph to an equilibrium. More explanation, implementation and results below.

## [Terrain Generator OpenGL ⛰️](https://github.com/LepronlineR/Terrain-Generator-OpenGL)
Generates a randomized terrain in OpenGL with tesselation. UI created and rendered with ImGUI.

The algorithm includes fractal noise, which includes custom parameters (frequency, octaves, lacunarity and persistence), as well as the Diamond-Square algorithm. Example on the left is generated with the diamond-square algorithm and the example on the right is generated with fractal noise. Watch the video below for more.

## [Inflection 📖😮](https://corppet.itch.io/astral-chart)

<div align="center">

</div>

A first person mystery game where the player has to investigate a death of a person that he is convicted the murder of. The game utilizes microsoft voice detection in order for the player to ask questions to the witness and a machine learning algorithm in order to process the voice and determine the inflection of the voice, determining the resulting response. 

In this instance, the player needs to find out the killer, and gets a small hint about what happened from a NPC about a key. The player finds the key and gives it to the NPC, which unlocks more of the mystery.
